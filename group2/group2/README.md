# Mythical Products Adventure Store

## Introduction
Our project represents a website/platform developed using the Django framework. This website allows users to buy mythical products and receive instructions for an adventure to obtain the purchased items. Users can sign up, log in, select mythical products, and make purchases. The application integrates the ChatGPT API to generate unique journey instructions for the user to retrieve their items. Additionally, it employs the Google Maps API to show the route from the userâ€™s current location/address to the locations of the purchased mythical items. After purchases, users can leave reviews on products, creating a feedback mechanism that enhances the application's functionality.
